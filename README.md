**Predictive Analysis for Amazon Sales Data**

**Project Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales data, focusing on identifying key patterns, predicting sales performance, and enhancing business insights. By leveraging machine learning and data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover meaningful insights, optimize operational efficiency, and support strategic decision-making for Amazon’s sales and inventory management.

**Data Source and Acquisition**

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle: Unlock Profits with E-commerce Sales Data. It contains extensive information on Amazon’s sales, including SKU codes, stock information, product categories, sizes, colors, order quantities, sales channels, and fulfillment types.


**Data Description**
The dataset provides in-depth insights into Amazon's sales structure, allowing analysis across multiple attributes such as:

Sales amounts and quantities

Order status and fulfillment types

Sales channels and shipping service levels

Product categories and promotional activity



**Project Goals:**


Visualize key distributions in sales data, including sales amounts and order quantities.

Conduct EDA to understand distributions in order status, fulfillment types, and product categories.

Bivariate analysis to explore relationships, e.g., between sales amount and order quantity.



**Predictive Modeling:**

**Sales Prediction**:Linear Regression to estimate sales amounts.

**Order Fulfillment Prediction**: Decision Tree for fulfillment status classification.

**Order Segmentation:** K-Means clustering to identify order patterns.

**Time Series Forecasting:** ARIMA for predicting future sales trends.

**Association Analysis:** Apriori algorithm for product category associations.




**Key Visualizations & Models:**



**Univariate and bivariate visualizations:** Histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
**Machine learning models:** Linear Regression, Decision Tree, K-Means clustering, ARIMA forecasting, and Apriori association.


**Business Value:**



**Inventory Optimization**:Predictive insights to balance stock levels.



**Enhanced Fulfillment & Shipping**: Accurate fulfillment and shipping predictions improve customer satisfaction.

**Marketing & Promotions**: Data-driven insights support targeted promotions.

**Operational Efficiency**: Clustering optimizes order and shipping processes.

**Strategic Planning**: Sales forecasts aid in long-term resource and strategy planning.
